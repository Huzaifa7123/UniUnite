    <h3>"It is needed because there is a difference of quality of education at university level. We have some
        universities labelled as elite or the best and others are less acknowledged. We aim to bring students from all
        universities together, no matter NUST, QAU, any private, Medical, Engineering university to coordinate and
        access quality course material."</h3> <br>
